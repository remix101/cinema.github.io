Demo Landing page for Genesis Deluxe Cinemas

NOTE: This project is neither affiliated with Genesis Deluxe Cinemas nor is it created to discredit the Brand Name. This is just to showcase how a Front-end Devloper would design the site from my own point of view.

This is how I envision the famous cinema in Nigeria should look like from a design perspective. The site is also mobile reponsive
